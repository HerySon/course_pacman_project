# Project Description

This project contains the code for student's project pacman multiagent of my AI course.
The code is forked from the original course project given at [Standford CSS 221](https://github.com/stanford-cs221/autumn2019/tree/gh-pages/assignments/pacman)

## Requirements

This code runs with python 3, you just need a recent version of python 3 installed and to clone this repository.

### troubleshooting

This code was translated from python 2 to 3, in case of error you might need to install the package `future`:

```zsh
pip install future
```

## Usage

You can start by running graphical layout to play manually with pacman:

```zsh
python pacman.py
```

For more details on commands options to run, see theÂ [commands file](commands.md)
